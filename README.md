## GenAI-Powered Web Summarizer Using Scrapeless

We’re building a Web Summarizer AI Agent that does the following:
- Extracts article links from any homepage (TechCrunch, The Verge, etc.)
- Falls back to RSS if no links are found dynamically
- Uses Scrapeless to extract full HTML from each article
- Uses LangChain + OpenAI to summarize content into 5 bullet points
- Saves summaries to SingleStore, making them searchable later

With this, you can instantly transform noisy news homepages into digestible intelligence streams—something useful for researchers, founders, journalists, or anyone who wants to stay ahead without getting overwhelmed.
